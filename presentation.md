# Assignment Instructions
A VIDEO DEMO (5-10 mins; second best) about the project developments and use of the Automated Software Development process; the video should focus on Demo of of your project, explanation about the Solution Architecture, perceived challenges and limitations of the automation process.

# Outline
## Introduction
{What is Important? Overview of the utilization of Generative AI and Multi-Agent Systems in the context of the project, focus on the use of Automated Software Development}
{What is missing in the state-of-the-art? Define the problem the project addresses.}
{What are are doing to get there? Clearly outline the report's goals. Describe the limits of the research project and areas the team chose to focus}

## Solution Design
- {Explain the Use Case or Project Scenario in detail (possibly from Lab 1)}
- {Define the roles of agents and multi-agent system in designing and implementing the project.}
- {Provide a workflow diagram or description showing processes being applied to promote Automated Software Development for this project}

## Solution Architecture
- {Include a clear visual representation of the system's architecture}
- {High-level explanation of the architecture focusing on the process of Automated Software Development, Multi-Agent Systems, Dynamic Pipelines or other processes being applied to design this solution (possibly form Lab 2)}
- {Detail the components applied for the project}
- {Describe tools, programming languages, and frameworks used}

## Methodology
- {Describe the application of genAI and automated solution design for the phases: planning, prototyping, testing, and deployment}
- {Specify tools and resources used for the development}
- {How was the process to decide and implementation the automation of specific tasks and processes}

## Challenge and Limitations
- {Highlight problems encountered during the application of genAI and automated solution design}
- {Describe areas where automation fell short or was impractical}

## Conclusion
- {Recap the main achievements and insights}
- {Suggest improvements or potential extensions of the project, focusing on the application of genAI and automated solution design and the project per se}
